<section id="about"><h2>About</h2><p>The Honor Society of the Philippines is the first and only honor society of the Philippines that espouses the University of the Philippines values of integrity, excellence, and service. It is a national academic society dedicated to recognizing outstanding achievement in scholarship and advancing the role of scholars in nation-building.
Founded by members of the University of the Philippines academic community and inspired by the legacy of Phi Kappa Phi Chapter 045, established in 1933, the Society is Filipino in spirit, grounded in history, and responsive to the needs of the nation and its people.</p></section>
<section id="mission"><h2>Mission & Values</h2><p>The mission of the Honor Society of the Philippines is to build a community of scholars and leaders who understand that scholarship is not an end in itself, but a responsibility. The Society affirms that honor is measured not by prestige or applause, but by service to the Filipino people.
In an age marked by division and intolerance, the Society upholds scholarship that places truth above ego, humility above self-promotion, and responsibility above recognition. </p>.</p></section>
